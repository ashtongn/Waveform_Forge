# Changelog

All notable changes to Waveform Forge are recorded here. Newest first.

The version number lives in `package.json`. This project uses simple semantic
versioning while pre-1.0: feature releases bump the **minor** number, small
fixes bump the **patch** number.

## v0.2.2 — Home Page Signal

**Pushed:** 2026-07-01

A visual refresh for the public landing page: a large, animated
frequency-spectrum signal now spans the full width of the page above the title.

### Added
- **Frequency signal** (`FrequencySignal`): a full-width Canvas 2D
  spectrum-analyzer trace — a jagged noise floor with a few drifting peaks —
  rendered above the home page title. It is DPR-aware, resizes with the
  viewport, pauses its animation when scrolled off-screen, and falls back to a
  single static frame under `prefers-reduced-motion`. Decorative only
  (`aria-hidden`), with no real signal data.

### Changed
- **Layout**: `Layout` now takes an opt-in `bleed` prop that drops the
  max-width and horizontal padding for full-width pages; the home route uses it.
  All other pages are unchanged.
- **Home page**: restructured so the signal spans edge-to-edge while the title,
  description, CTAs, and module cards keep the standard reading column. The
  auth-aware calls to action are preserved.
- **Palette**: added a `forge.signal` accent color.
- **Version**: `0.2.1` → `0.2.2`.

## v0.2.1 — Equipment Tracker

**Pushed:** 2026-07-01

First member feature: a shared team equipment tracker, plus a wider app layout
to give data-dense pages room to breathe.

### Added
- **Equipment tracker** (`/app/equipment`, approved members only): add / edit /
  delete gear, per-person check-out and (partial) return, mark units in service
  and back to available, live search, status/category filters, sort, summary
  stat cards, and collapsible groups. Records live in a shared `equipment`
  Firestore collection; status and available/checked-out counts are derived,
  not stored.
- **Navigation**: an "Equipment" header link and a member-home card link into
  the tracker (both visible to approved members only).

### Changed
- **Layout width**: `Layout` now takes a `wide` prop. Signed-in app pages
  (`/app`, `/app/equipment`, `/admin`) render in a wide shell
  (`max-w-screen-2xl`) so tables no longer force horizontal scrolling; public
  and auth pages keep the standard `max-w-5xl` reading width. Header and footer
  share the active width so their edges stay aligned. New app pages inherit the
  wide shell automatically.
- **Equipment layout**: the add/edit form and inventory sit side by side (form
  is sticky on large screens), matching the reference workflow.
- **Version**: `0.2.0` → `0.2.1`.

### Firestore
- Adds one security-rules block for the `equipment` collection
  (`allow read, create, update, delete: if isApproved() || isAdmin()`). No
  indexes required (filtering/sorting is client-side). No new manual console
  steps for this release beyond publishing the rules.

## v0.2.0 — Phase 1: Authentication & Admin Approval

**Pushed:** 2026-07-01

First functional release beyond the Phase 0 scaffold. Adds a complete
sign-up → admin-approval → member-access flow, enforced by Firestore Security
Rules (free Spark plan — no backend, no Cloud Functions).

### Added
- **Auth context** (`src/auth/`): `AuthProvider` tracks Firebase Auth and
  live-subscribes to the signed-in user's `/profiles/{uid}` document, exposing
  `{ user, profile, loading }` via the `useAuth()` hook.
- **Sign-up & login pages** (`/signup`, `/login`): email/password auth. Sign-up
  creates a `/profiles/{uid}` document as `member` / `pending`.
- **Account-status screen**: shown to signed-in but unapproved users. Denied
  users can re-request review (moves them back to `pending`).
- **Route guards**: `RequireApproved` (member routes) and `RequireAdmin` (admin
  routes), plus a shared `LoadingScreen` to prevent redirect flashes.
- **Protected routes**: `/app` (approved members) and `/admin` (admin only),
  currently backed by placeholder landing pages for future features.
- **Admin approval queue** (`/admin`): real-time list of sign-ups with
  Approve / Deny actions; approving a user updates their session instantly.
- **Auth-aware navigation**: the header now shows Sign in / Sign out and
  conditional Members / Admin links; the Home page "Team sign-in" button is now
  live (previously a static placeholder).
- **Docs**: `docs/DEV_LOG.md` development log covering Phase 0 and Phase 1.

### Changed
- **Firestore rules** (`firestore.rules`): replaced deny-all with the
  `profiles` model. Admin authority is anchored to a hard-coded admin UID (not a
  forgeable field). Users may create only their own pending profile; only the
  admin may approve/deny; denied users may re-request.
- **Version**: `0.1.0` → `0.2.0`.

### Deployment notes
- The Firebase web config is now bundled into the build (the auth code imports
  `src/lib/firebase.ts` for the first time). The six `VITE_FIREBASE_*` GitHub
  Actions secrets are injected automatically by the Pages workflow.
- Firestore rules are deployed separately via the Firebase Console (or
  `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`) — they do not ship with the site.
